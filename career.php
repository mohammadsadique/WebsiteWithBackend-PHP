<h3>Wait, don't apply right now!</h3>
<h4>First read these pointers, they are not guidelines, they are your lifelines:</h4>
</div>
<div class="grid6 fl lside">
<h5>Resumes, not autobiographies:</h5>
<p>Nobody here is fond of reading and neither do we have the time. So keep your application short and simple. We will (pretend to) hear about your school tournaments and debate competitions when we meet up. Let your resume be all about business. Tell us what you do and how well you do it. Remember, first impression leads to the second and the third and … if you get lucky, an interview.</p>
</div>
<div class="grid6 fl rside">
<h5>Don't assault our sensibilities:</h5>
<p>Listen up, everyone – we love creativity and encourage it, but not when it comes in the form of candy pink resumes decorated with glitter or lipstick marks. Please don't try to 'stand out'; outstanding is just fine with us. Also avoid taking print outs of your resume while eating burgers; we can't stand sloppiness (and smell of burgers when on a diet).</p>

					<h3>Don't fit any of the above? You could still be lucky!</h3>
					<h4>If you're young, have an awesome sense of humour, got great ideas for us, and haven't figured out how you suit our set-up, you must still apply. <strong>It's always good to have jolly good people around us, and we will find a way to bring you aboard.</strong></h4>
